    In a digital realm where silence reigns,
    Where code weaves webs, complex and vast,
    There stands a beacon midst the plains,
    Pelican, steadfast, holding fast.

    Crafting from the whispers of the web,
    Static sites, swift and light,
    On foundations strong, no ebb,
    A lighthouse, in the coder's night.

    Markdown and reStructuredText,
    Bend to its will, content transformed,
    In themes and plugins, it's expressed,
    A digital landscape, warmly adorned.

    No database chains to drag it down,
    It flies, unburdened, through the code,
    Turning binaries to a crown,
    On every path that it has strode.

    So here's to Pelican, our guide,
    Through static realms, it leads the way,
    In its simplicity, we take pride,
    A beacon, shining bright as day.
