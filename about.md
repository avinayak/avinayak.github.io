# About ¬

Hi! I'm Atul. I'm a programmer based around Tokyo. This is a blog that covers some of the experiments that I do in my spare time. 

I'm also [@yakinavault](https://twitter.com/yakinavault) on twitter. I use this account primarily for experimental stuff.

Feel free to email me at su.atul.vi - gmail.com if you have any queries.
