There was this rough idea I've been thinking about in [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) for a really long time.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I wonder if it's possible to use some kind of stochastic algorithm that gives you an initial state which forms legible text after many cycles.</p>â€” yakinavault (@yakinavault) <a href="https://twitter.com/yakinavault/status/1291586306489761792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I came across [an article](https://kevingal.com/blog/mona-lisa-gol.html) of the same title by Kevin Galligan recently and I thought I could do something similar using a different approach. What if instead of using SAT Solvers, I use some kind of heuristic algorithm that could somehow "program" a large world of Game of Life to display an image after a few generations?

I began working on a proof of concept version using the hill climbing technique. The idea was very simple.

1. Initialize variable best-score = infinity and an empty matrix as best-result
2. Start with a random matrix of 1s and 0s representing live and dead cells in Life.
3. Invert a single cell at a random location. 
   1. Compute a score of how close the matrix is with the target.
   2. If the score is less than best_score
      1. set it as best score and set the current matrix as best-result
   3.  else
      1. copy best result to current matrix
4. Repeat 3
