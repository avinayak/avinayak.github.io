I came across [this](https://kevingal.com/blog/mona-lisa-gol.html) article of the same title by Kevin Galligan recently and I wanted to do something similar using a different approach. What if instead of using SAT Solvers, I use some kind of heuristic algorithm that could somehow program a large world of Game of Life to display an image after a few generations?
