There was this rough idea I've been thinking about in [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) for a really long time. 

I came across [this](https://kevingal.com/blog/mona-lisa-gol.html) article of the same title by Kevin Galligan recently and I wanted to do something similar using a different approach. What if instead of using SAT Solvers, I use some kind of heuristic algorithm that could somehow "program" a large world of Game of Life to display an image after a few generations?
