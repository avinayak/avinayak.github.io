I"Õ<p>Maze Generation started out as an experiment.</p>

<p>I was fascinated by maze generation algorithms. I used a randomized version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Randomized_Kruskal's_algorithm">Kruskalâ€™s algorithm</a>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-txt" data-lang="txt">Create a list of all walls, and create a set for each cell, 
each containing just that one cell.

For each wall, in some random order:
    If the cells divided by this wall belong to distinct sets:
        Remove the current wall.
        Join the sets of the formerly divided cells.</code></pre></figure>

<p>I tried to do it in python in the begining, and later in C (for practice). The algorithm scaled really well, and I used it to generate huuge mazes of ~5GB with a single path between points.</p>

<p>The project took about a week to complete. Later on, the algorithm was used to design a real physical maze game in college.</p>

<p>The UI was witten in C using the excellent GTK Libraries, and Clutter for Vector graphics.</p>

<p>A few days later, I explored the Dead end filling algorithm to solve any randomly generated maze.</p>

<p>Now, at this point, I thought itâ€™d be cool if i could turn it into a game :). soâ€¦</p>

<p>The human player is blue and a Computer player is red. The aim of the game is to get to the ohter diagonal end first. I had to adjust the velocity of the computer palyer so that itâ€™s nearly impossible to beat the machine, unless you time your keystrokes accurately and not make <strong>any</strong> mistakes.</p>

<p>Here is a youtube video (mute to avoid the horrible background music) of the path the Machine takes to solve. <em>This is not how dead end filling works</em> . The maze is already solved. Iâ€™m just animating the solution path.</p>
