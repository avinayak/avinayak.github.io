<p>OK, So I saw this in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/bdar7/colourful_5min_breakout_style_game_seriously_play">reddit</a>.</p>

<p>And I wanted to do something like that. I had plans to mess around with Box2D for a long time but didnâ€™t get the opportunity. After a dayâ€™s worth of research,
I found out that Blender does a much better job in Physics simulation, and it has a Python interpreter. I couldnâ€™t ask for more. and I made this!</p>

<p>As you can see, the particles are not really particles here. Theyâ€™re more like blocks. This is actually a 3D simulation.
The camera faces the Z-axis orthogonally in isometric view. In the beginning, there were no colors and the blocks were arranged into a huge rectangle. 
But I knew it looks much more satisfying if I did something similar to this (I was waiting for a real life application for this Programing 101 snippet) ðŸ˜‰</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="k">for</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">){</span>
    <span class="k">for</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">j</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="n">j</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="n">j</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">){</span>
        <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"* "</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="cm">/* Outputs

*/</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Also, I(Me being the idiot that I am), didnâ€™t know the existence of the HSV/HSL functions, which wouldâ€™ve made my life much easier. Instead, I had to implement this.</p>

<p>With HSV(), I smoothly mapped the X locations of blocks with an H value, keeping S and V fixed.</p>

<p>In the end, I wanted to reduce the block size so that theyâ€™re more like particles, but my potato computer took ~ 30 Hrs to render this ðŸ˜•.</p>
