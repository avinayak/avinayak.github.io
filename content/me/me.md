# About Me

Hi! I’m Atul Vinayak, a programmer based around Vancouver, Canada.

I Started working as a programmer from 2015. Mostly a python programmer, but also knows Java, C, C#, JavaScript etc.
Started learning on Scala and Elixir from 2019. First programming language was ActionScript! I wanted to be a flash game dev when I was really young.

I have a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from University of Kerala. 

I worked in Japan during the COVID years, where I picked up a hobby of making tiny JS [programs that fit in a tweet](https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%81%A4%E3%81%B6%E3%82%84%E3%81%8DProcessing). [example](https://twitter.com/atulvinayak/status/1305116417419653120). 

I moved to Vancouver in December 2022. Currently trying to learn Haskell. I have a lot of side project ideas that I’m trying to work on in the weekends. I’m also learning 3D modelling in Blender. 

Outside of computers, I love going on hikes. I love [photography](https://unsplash.com/collections/519921/s'ok-pics). I take photos on an old analog camera.
