![](/media/atul-vinayak-aU2Xvdhh-mQ-unsplash\(1\).jpg)I was trying to generate [Pythagoras Tree fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras_tree_\(fractal\)) in p5js, when I decide to see what would happen If I add random() in the branch angle code. It turns out that with high amount of branching, this can give some cool photorealsitic dandelionesque flower images.

It started out really tame like this. These are really just circles with constant radii.

With some tweaking of branch angles using random + radii of circle being a function of branch depth.\
