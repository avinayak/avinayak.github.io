So.. I made a popular tweet last week in the [#つぶやきProcessing](https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%81%A4%E3%81%B6%E3%82%84%E3%81%8DProcessing?src=hashtag_click) circles.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="cy" dir="ltr">j=24,m=0,draw=(a=>{for(v=(i=>w/3*(n=noise)(i)-k),createCanvas(w=1e3,w),noFill(),background('<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fd7?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#fd7</a>'),translate(0,m--),i=0,y=0;y<w-m;y+=j)for(x=k=90;x<w-k;x+=9)if(y+k>-m?curve(v(i++)+x,v(i++)+y,x,j+y,x+9,j+y,v(i++)+x,v(i++)+y):i+=4,x+=v(i++)%9,n(x*y)<.13)y+=j});//<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%81%A4%E3%81%B6%E3%82%84%E3%81%8DProcessing?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#つぶやきProcessing</a> <a href="https://t.co/WNIwAAAXjQ">pic.twitter.com/WNIwAAAXjQ</a></p>— atulvinayak (@atulvinayak) <a href="https://twitter.com/atulvinayak/status/1305116417419653120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 13, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I'll try to explain how this script worked and how I was able to fit the whole thing into 280 characters.

# Story and Previous works

All of this started when last week when I was experimenting with the p5js `curve()` function. Internally this is an implementation of the [Centripetal Catmull–Rom spline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_Catmull%E2%80%93Rom_spline "Centripetal Catmull–Rom spline"). I tried generating a bunch of 8 legged water spiders(!) from an alternate twitter account which very few people saw.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">w=1e3;setup=_=>{createCanvas(w, w);noFill();v=Array(1e4).fill(0).map(_=>w/4+random(w/2))};t=0;draw=_=>{t+=0.1;i=0;m=7;background('<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%81%A4%E3%81%B6%E3%82%84%E3%81%8DProcessing?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#つぶやきProcessing</a>');while(m-->0)curve(v\[i++\]*cos(t+v\[i++\]),v\[i++\]*sin(t+v\[i++\]),w/2,w/2,v\[i++\],v\[i++\],v\[i++\]*cos(t+v\[i++\]),v\[i++\]*sin(t+v\[i++\]));} <a href="https://t.co/rT0GsBQHVH">pic.twitter.com/rT0GsBQHVH</a></p>— dawnbreaker (@dawnbreakr_) <a href="https://twitter.com/dawnbreakr_/status/1303620597839097858?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 9, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I admit this looks pretty stupid. The aim was to generate an animation a whole bunch of water spiders with the camera panning around. But then, for me to understand how exactly the Catmull-Rom spline worked, I decided to randomly plot a bunch of curves on a 2D canvas.

I did exactly that, and It somehow resembled handwriting from my native language ([Malayalam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam)).

Reducing character spacing.. Do you see the similarity now?

Also, at this time I was playing the PC remaster of [Journey (2012)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_(2012_video_game)). Journey has a very beautiful blocky scriptures all over the temples in the game.

I guessed this is pretty easy generate. I made a few attempts to reproduce the approximate style using p5.js

and even an infinite scrolling version

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">w=1e3;s=20;setup=_=>createCanvas(w,w);t=0;draw=_=>{noStroke();translate(-10,t-=1);for(v=x=0;x<w;x+=s,v=x/s)for(z=y=0;y<w-t;y+=s,z=y/s){fill(p=z%5<2||v%6<3?0:\~\~(noise(v,z)*2.2)*255,p-70,0);rect(x,y,s,s)}}<br>//<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%81%A4%E3%81%B6%E3%82%84%E3%81%8DProcessing?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#つぶやきProcessing</a> <a href="https://t.co/yEdjdZeKfu">pic.twitter.com/yEdjdZeKfu</a></p>— dawnbreaker (@dawnbreakr_) <a href="https://twitter.com/dawnbreakr_/status/1304311898880405505?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 11, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This script has some serious performance issues, which I resolved in the tweet.

Later I learned that this style of meaningless writing is a thing in the art community known as Generative [Asemic Writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asemic_writing). According to Wikipedia:

> **Asemic writing** is a wordless open semantic form of writing. The word asemic means "having no specific semantic content". With the nonspecificity of asemic writing there comes a vacuum of meaning which is left for the reader to fill in and interpret.

I decided to combine the two and make an infinite generator of malayalam-esque ascemic writing. I've seen curve generated ascemic before. like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/asemic/comments/dw5ze3/generative_script/?ref=share&ref_source=link). So, What I did is in no way something that's never seen before. However, maybe the way I made it infinite scrolling was something new(?). I'll try to explain how the code works..

# Code

Fun fact: I lost the original script in the minifying process. But I managed to recover the essence of it..

    var j = 24;
    var scrollPosition = 0;
    var canvasWidth = 800;
    var margin = 90
    
    function setup() {
        createCanvas(canvasWidth, canvasWidth)
        noFill();
    }
    
    function deterministicRandom(index) {
      return 1000 / 3 * noise(index) - 90
    }
    
    function draw() {
        background('#fd7');
        translate(0, scrollPosition--);
    
        for (i = 0, y = 0; y < canvasWidth - scrollPosition; y += j)
            for (x = 90; x < canvasWidth - margin; x+=9) {
                if (y + margin > -scrollPosition) {
                    curve(
                      deterministicRandom(i++) + x, 
                      deterministicRandom(i++) + y, 
                      x, 
                      j + y, 
                      x + 9, 
                      j + y, 
                      deterministicRandom(i++) + x, 
                      deterministicRandom(i++) + y
                    )
                } else {
                    i += 4
                }
                x += deterministicRandom(i++) % 9
                if (noise(x * y) < .13)
                {
                  y += 2*j
                  x = margin
                }
            }
    }

The most important part of the code is the function `deterministicRandom()` which is used a lot of times in the sketch. It's basically `noise()` but mapped to range `[333, -90]`. p5 js `curve()` takes in 2 control point and 2 physical point coordinate to determine the location and shape of the curve. Each character is is thus a set of 4 deterministically random numbers for control points + 4 constants for physical points. all of these points are offset by a base `<x,y>` coordinate to place the curve in a line. 

The 2 loops iterate over x and y, at a constant rate. x by 9 pixels and y by 24 pixels. But, inside the loop, based on deterministic random, x is randomly incremented by upto 9 pixels to simulate the randomness in spaces between characters. Also, if for a random condition with somewhat low probability (`noise(x * y) < .13`), a line-break is added. Which means, y is incremented thrice in that loop and x is set to a margin value (90).

# Camera motion and line rendering

The infinite scroll effect is basically done using `translate(0, scrollPosition--)`. The loop termination clause is adjusted such that only lines within the frame are rendered (between `y = scrollPosition to scrollPosition+canvasHeight`). The condition `y + margin > -scrollPosition` directly inside the loop checks for this. This also offsets the random number index to the one needed by the lines being rendered in the else case. Here's a version of the script that shows lines being rendered as the script runs:
