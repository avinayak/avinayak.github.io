Maze Generation started out as an experiment.

I was fascinated by maze generation algorithms. I used a randomized version of [Kruskal’s algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Randomized_Kruskal's_algorithm). 





{% highlight txt %}

Create a list of all walls, and create a set for each cell, 
each containing just that one cell.

For each wall, in some random order:
    If the cells divided by this wall belong to distinct sets:
        Remove the current wall.
        Join the sets of the formerly divided cells.
{% endhighlight %}

I tried to do it in python in the begining, and later in C (for practice). The algorithm scaled really well, and I used it to generate huuge mazes of ~5GB with a single path between points.

The project took about a week to complete. Later on, the algorithm was used to design a real physical maze game in college.

The UI was witten in C using the excellent GTK Libraries, and Clutter for Vector graphics.

A few days later, I explored the Dead end filling algorithm to solve any randomly generated maze.

Now, at this point, I thought it’d be cool if i could turn it into a game :). so…

The human player is blue and a Computer player is red. The aim of the game is to get to the ohter diagonal end first. I had to adjust the velocity of the computer palyer so that it’s nearly impossible to beat the machine, unless you time your keystrokes accurately and not make **any** mistakes.

Here is a youtube video (mute to avoid the horrible background music) of the path the Machine takes to solve. *This is not how dead end filling works* . The maze is already solved. I’m just animating the solution path.
