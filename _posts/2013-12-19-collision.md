OK, So I saw this in [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/bdar7/colourful_5min_breakout_style_game_seriously_play).

And I wanted to do something like that. I had plans to mess around with Box2D for a long time but didnâ€™t get the opportunity. After a dayâ€™s worth of research,
I found out that Blender does a much better job in Physics simulation, and it has a Python interpreter. I couldnâ€™t ask for more. and I made this!

As you can see, the particles are not really particles here. Theyâ€™re more like blocks. This is actually a 3D simulation.
The camera faces the Z-axis orthogonally in isometric view. In the beginning, there were no colors and the blocks were arranged into a huge rectangle. 
But I knew it looks much more satisfying if I did something similar to this (I was waiting for a real life application for this Programing 101 snippet) ðŸ˜‰

{% highlight c %}
for(int i=0;i<5;i++){
    for(int j=0;j<i;j++){
        printf("* ");
    }
    printf("\n");
}

/* Outputs 

* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 

*/

{% endhighlight %}

Also, I(Me being the idiot that I am), didnâ€™t know the existence of the HSV/HSL functions, which wouldâ€™ve made my life much easier. Instead, I had to implement this.

With HSV(), I smoothly mapped the X locations of blocks with an H value, keeping S and V fixed.

In the end, I wanted to reduce the block size so that theyâ€™re more like particles, but my potato computer took ~ 30 Hrs to render this ðŸ˜•.
